						The animals were imperfect,
						long-tailed,
						unfortunate in their heads.
						Little by little they
						put themselves together,
						making themselves a landscape,
						acquiring spots, grace, flight.
						The cat,
						only the cat
						appeared complete and proud:
						he was born completely finished,
						walking alone and knowing what he wanted.

					<p>
						I don't believe in age.
						All old people
						carry
						in their eyes,
						a child,
						and children,
						at times
						observe us with the
						eyes of wise ancients.
						Shall we measure
						life
						in meters or kilometers
						or months?
						How far since you were born?
						How long
						must you wander
						until
						like all men
						instead of walking on its surface
						we rest below the earth?

					<p>
						Oceanic dawn
						at the center
						of my life,
						waves like grapes,
						the sky's solitude,
						you fill me
						and flood
						the complete sea,
						the undiminished sky,
						tempo
						and space,
						sea foam's white
						battalions,
						the orange earth,
						the sun's
						fiery waist
						in agony,
						so many
						gifts and talents,
						birds soaring into their dreams,
						and the sea, the sea,
						suspended
						aroma,
						chorus of rich, resonant salt,
						and meanwhile,
						we men,
						touch the water,
						struggling,
						and hoping,
						we touch the sea,
						hoping.
