                            The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of
                            domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl.
                            It is one of the most common and widespread domestic
                             animals, with a population of more than 19 billion
                             as of 2011.[1] Humans keep chickens primarily as a
                             source of food, consuming both their meat and their
                             eggs.
                             Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal
                             origins in Southeast-, East-,[2] and South Asia, but
                             with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the
                             Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian
                             subcontinent. From India, the domesticated chicken
                             was imported to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to
                             Greece by the fifth century BC.[3] Fowl had been known
                             in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird
                             that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from
                             the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according
                             to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] The chicken
                             genome has changed less from feathered ancestors
                             eradicated by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event
                             than those of other sequenced avian dinosaurs.[7]
                             The domestic chicken is descended primarily from the
                             red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and is scientifically
                             classified as the same species.[21] As such it can
                             and does freely interbreed with populations of red
                             jungle fowl.[21] Recent genetic analysis has revealed
                             that at least the gene for yellow skin was incorporated
                             into domestic birds through hybridization with the
                             grey junglefowl (G. sonneratii).[22] The traditional
                             poultry farming view is that chickens were first
                             domesticated for cockfighting in Asia, Africa, and
                             Europe, rather than for egg or meat production. In
                             the last decade there have been a number of genetic
                             studies to clarify the origins. According to one study,
                             a single domestication event occurring in the region
                             of modern Thailand created the modern chicken with
                             minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[23]
                             However, that study was later found to be based on
                             incomplete data, and recent studies point to multiple
                             maternal origins, with the clade found in the Americas,
                             Europe, Middle East, and Africa, originating from the
                             Indian subcontinent, where a large number of unique
                             haplotypes occur.[24][25] It is postulated that the
                             jungle fowl, known as the bamboo fowl in many Southeast
                             Asian languages, is a special pheasant well adapted
                             to take advantage of the large amounts of fruits that
                             are produced during the end of the 50-year bamboo seeding
                             cycle to boost its own reproduction.[26] In domesticating
                             the chicken, humans took advantage of this prolific
                             reproduction of the jungle fowl when exposed to large
                             amounts of food.[27]

                             It has been claimed (based on paleoclimatic assumptions)
                             that chickens were domesticated in Southern China in
                             6000 BC.[28] However, according to a recent study,[29]
                             it is unclear whether those birds were the ancestors
                             of chickens today. Instead, the origin could be the
                             Harappan culture of the Indus Valley. Eventually, the
                             chicken moved to the Tarim basin of central Asia. The
                             chicken reached Europe (Romania, Turkey, Greece, Ukraine)
                             about 3000 BC.[30] Introduction into Western Europe
                             came far later, about the 1st millennium BC. Phoenicians
                             spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts, to
                             Iberia. Breeding increased under the Roman Empire,
                             and was reduced in the Middle Ages.[30] Middle East
                             traces of chicken go back to a little earlier than
                             2000 BC, in Syria; chicken went southward only in
                             the 1st millennium BC. The chicken reached Egypt for
                             purposes of cock fighting about 1400 BC, and became
                             widely bred only in Ptolemaic Egypt (about 300 BC).[30]
                             Little is known about the chicken's introduction into
                             Africa. Three possible routes of introduction in about
                             the early first millennium AD could have been through
                             the Egyptian Nile Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek
                             or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers,
                             across the Sahara. The earliest known remains are from
                             Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date
                             back to the middle of the first millennium AD.[30]
                             Domestic chicken in the Americas before Western conquest
                             is still an ongoing discussion, but blue-egged chickens,
                             found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian
                             origin for early American chickens.[30]
                             A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian
                             subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa
                             makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread
                             of chickens in these areas; better description and
                             genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction
                             may also help with research into this area.[30]
                             Since antiquity chickens have been, and still are,
                             a sacred animal in some cultures[52] and deeply embedded
                             within belief systems and religious worship. The term
                             "Persian bird" for the cock appears to have been given
                             by the Greeks after Persian contact "because of his
                             great importance and his religious use among the Persians".[53]
                             In Indonesia the chicken has great significance during
                             the Hindu cremation ceremony. A chicken is considered
                             a channel for evil spirits which may be present during
                             the ceremony. A chicken is tethered by the leg and
                             kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure
                             that any evil spirits present go into the chicken and
                             not the family members. The chicken is then taken home
                             and returns to its normal life.
                             In ancient Greece, the chicken was not normally used
                             for sacrifices, perhaps because it was still considered
                             an exotic animal. Because of its valor, the cock is
                             found as an attribute of Ares, Heracles, and Athena.
                             The alleged last words of Socrates as he died from
                             hemlock poisoning, as recounted by Plato, were "Crito,
                             I owe a cock to Asclepius; will you remember to pay
                             the debt?", signifying that death was a cure for the
                             illness of life.
                             The Greeks believed that even lions were afraid of
                             roosters. Several of Aesop's Fables reference this
                             belief.
                             In the New Testament, Jesus prophesied the betrayal
                             by Peter: "Jesus answered, 'I tell you, Peter, before
                             the rooster crows today, you will deny three times
                             that you know me.'"[54] It happened,[55] and Peter
                             cried bitterly. This made the rooster a symbol for
                             both vigilance and betrayal.
                             Earlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen when
                             talking about Jerusalem: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you
                             who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you,
                             how often I have longed to gather your children together,
                             as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you
                             were not willing."[56]
                             In the sixth century, Pope Gregory I declared the rooster
                             the emblem of Christianity[57] and another Papal enactment
                             of the ninth century by Pope Nicholas I[52] ordered
                             the figure of the rooster to be placed on every church
                             steeple.[58]
                             In many Central European folk tales, the devil is believed
                             to flee at the first crowing of a rooster.
                             In traditional Jewish practice, a kosher animal is
                             swung around the head and then slaughtered on the
                             afternoon before Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement,
                             in a ritual called kapparos; it is now common practice
                             to cradle the bird and move it around the head. A chicken
                             or fish is typically used because it is commonly available
                             (and small enough to hold). The sacrifice of the animal
                             is to receive atonement, for the animal symbolically
                             takes on all the person's sins in kapparos. The meat
                             is then donated to the poor. A woman brings a hen for
                             the ceremony, while a man brings a rooster. Although
                             not a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of
                             the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or
                             her life is in God's hands.
                             The Talmud speaks of learning "courtesy toward one's
                             mate" from the rooster.[59] This might refer to the
                             fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat,
                             he calls his hens to eat first. The Talmud likewise
                             provides us with the statement "Had the Torah not been
                             given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats,
                             honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry
                             from cocks,"[60][61] which may be further understood
                             as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in
                             the context of a religious instilling vessel of "a
                             girt one of the loins" (Young's Literal Translation)
                             that which is "stately in his stride" and "move with
                             stately bearing" in the Book of Proverbs 30:29-31 as
                             referenced by Michael V. Fox in his Proverbs 10-31
                             where Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon (Saadia Gaon) identifies
                             the definitive trait of "A cock girded about the loins"
                             in Proverbs 30:31 (Douay–Rheims Bible) as "the honesty
                             of their behavior and their success",[62] identifying
                             a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that
                             religious instilling schema of purpose and use.
                             The chicken is one of the Zodiac symbols of the Chinese
                             calendar. In Chinese folk religion, a cooked chicken
                             as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor
                             veneration and worship of village deities. Vegetarian
                             deities such as the Buddha are not recipients of such
                             offerings. Under some observations, an offering of
                             chicken is presented with "serious" prayer (while roasted
                             pork is offered during a joyous celebration). In Confucian
                             Chinese weddings, a chicken can be used as a substitute
                             for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.g.,
                             sudden death) to attend the ceremony. A red silk scarf
                             is placed on the chicken's head and a close relative
                             of the absent bride/groom holds the chicken so the
                             ceremony may proceed. However, this practice is rare
                             today.
                             A cockatrice was supposed to have been born from an
                             egg laid by a rooster, as well as killed by a rooster's
                             call.

                            Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. Beef
                            can be harvested from bulls, heifers or steers. Its
                            acceptability as a food source varies in different
                            parts of the world.

                            Beef muscle meat can be cut into roasts, short ribs
                            or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib
                            steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.) Some cuts
                            are processed (corned beef or beef jerky), and trimmings,
                            usually mixed with meat from older, leaner cattle, are
                            ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used
                            in some varieties of blood sausage. Other parts that
                            are eaten include the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from
                            the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas
                            and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the
                            brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of
                            bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE), the kidneys,
                            and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United
                            States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain
                            oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as-is,
                            but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage
                            casings. The bones are used for making beef stock.

                            Beef from steers and heifers is very similar. According
                            to the most recent National Beef Quality Audit, heifer
                            carcasses had slightly more marbling than steer carcasses,
                            but USDA quality grade was not significantly different.[1]
                            Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for
                            breeding varies. The meat from older bulls is usually
                            tougher, so it is frequently used for mince (known as
                            ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for
                            beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may
                            be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large
                            feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated
                            animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed
                            a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral
                            preblend.

                            Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world,
                            accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide,
                            after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.[2]
                            In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and
                            the People's Republic of China are the world's three
                            largest consumers of beef; however, Uruguay has the
                            highest beef and veal consumption per capita, followed
                            by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data from
                            OECD, the average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of
                            beef or veal in 2014, representing the highest beef/veal
                            consumption per capita in the world. In comparison,
                            the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb)
                            beef or veal in the same year, while African countries,
                            such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the
                            least beef or veal per capita.

                            In 2014, the world's largest exporters of beef were
                            Brazil, Australia and the United States, respectively.[3]
                            Beef production is also important to the economies of
                            Uruguay, Canada, Paraguay, Mexico, Argentina, Belarus
                            and Nicaragua.





                            Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨?) is a type of food preparation
                            originating in Japan, consisting of cooked vinegared
                            rice (鮨飯 sushi-meshi) combined with other ingredients
                            (ネタ neta) such as raw seafood, vegetables and sometimes
                            tropical fruits. Ingredients and forms of sushi presentation
                            vary widely, but the ingredient which all sushi have
                            in common is rice (also referred to as shari (しゃり)
                            or sumeshi (酢飯)). Although commonly mistaken for sushi,
                            sashimi, which is also a Japanese delicacy, consists
                            of thinly sliced raw fish and may or may not be served
                            with rice.
                            Sushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice.
                            It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some common
                            varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients and many are
                            vegetarian. Sushi is often served with pickled ginger,
                            wasabi, and soy sauce. Popular garnishes are often made
                            using daikon.
